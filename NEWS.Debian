nginx (1.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Started with nginx 1.4.1-2 upload, nginx-naxsi-ui switched backend from
  MySQL to SQLite.

  This was mostly caused by the future removal of MySQL support in naxsi-ui.
  Thus, the nginx maintainers decided to switch from MySQL to SQLite.

  All data contained in the MySQL database is not affected by this switch but
  you need to start with a clean SQLite database to ensure nginx-naxsi-ui
  reliability.

  Should you get the following error while starting nginx:

    could not build the server_names_hash, you should increase
    server_names_hash_bucket_size: 32

  Please add the following parameter to your nginx.conf:

    server_names_hash_bucket_size 100;

  Where 100 is the size of your server names hash bucket. For more information
  about this option, please read the following resources:

nginx (0.6.30-2) unstable; urgency=low

  As of May 4th., nginx 0.5.x branch is considered legacy and 0.6.x will
  be the new stable branch. The announcement was made by Igor Sysoev when
  releasing the last 0.5.x version, nginx 0.5.36.

  Debian, the universal operating system, has provided binary packages for
  both 0.5 and 0.6 branches in unstable and experimental, and will now offer
  only 0.6 packages in the unstable distribution, starting with the
  0.6.30-1 package.

  In the future, Debian will also provide experimental packages for the
  next testing branch of nginx, at the moment upstream announces it.

  Should you have any problem with nginx in Debian, please file a bug in
  the Debian Bug Tracking System.
