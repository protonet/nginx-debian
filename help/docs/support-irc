Nginx has a moderately active IRC channel on Freenode.

You can get there by:
  * Client
    Using an IRC Client and pointing it to:
    #nginx on irc.freenode.net
  * Browser
    Opening a web browser and pointing it to:
    http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=nginx

Common sense is expected to be followed:
  * Code of Conduct
    http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct
  * IRC Etiquette
    http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/etiquette.html
  * Patience
    If somebody doesn't answer you right away, then wait.
    Even active IRC users have to run off sometimes.
